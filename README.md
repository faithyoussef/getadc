# getadc

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
 i assembled this project using the help of github project , i didn't use the code unless i understood it.
 i also would like to refer that i am not used to such puzzle building code so i used the help that i could use right.
 the project isnot fully completed, and it might be messy because github has changed the look of the window that leads to this point. 
 so please forgive me on such a point.
